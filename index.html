    <h5>DevOps Engineering</h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Experienced in automating infrastructure deployment using tools such as Terraform resulting in a 40% reduction in
            manual configuration errors and improved system reliability for managing cloud-based systems at scale.</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline for a Kubernetes-based microservices architecture reducing deployment time
            by 50% and increasing overall system reliability by 30%.</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented an automated solution for provisioning, configuring, and managing AWS services, which reduced
            manual effort by 80% and improved system reliability by 30%.</li>
            <li>Streamlined a Kubernetes-based autoscaling solution, resulting in a 25% reduction in infrastructure costs and a 15%
            increase in application performance during peak traffic periods.</li>
            <li>Implemented automated backup and recovery procedures to reduce data loss by 80% and improve system availability by
            25%.</li>
            <li>Automated the deployment and configuration of cloud-based applications using ArgoCD tool to reduce deployment time and
            minimization of human error.</li>
